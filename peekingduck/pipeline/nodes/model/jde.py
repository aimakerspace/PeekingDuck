    """Initialise and use the JDE model to detect and track people from
    image frame.

    The JDE model node allows target detection and appearance embedding
    to be learned in a shared model. In addition, the authors further
    propose a simple and fast association method that works in conjunction
    with the joint model. This implementation is inference only, and any
    training code is stripped from the repository and model weights.

    Inputs:
        |img|

    Outputs:
        |bboxes|

        |obj_tags|

        |bbox_labels|

    Configs:
        weights_dir (:obj:`List`):
            Directory pointing to the model weights.
        blob_file (:obj:`str`):
            Mame of file to be downloaded, if weights are not found in
            ``weights_dir``.
        model_files (:obj:`Dict`):
            Dictionary pointing to path of the model weights file and model
            config file.
        iou_threshold (:obj:`float`): **default = 0.5**. |br|
            Threshold value for intersecton over union of detections.
        score_threshold (:obj:`float`): **default = 0.5**. |br|
            Object confidence score threshold.
        nms_threshold (:obj:`float`): **default = 0.4**. |br|
            Threshold values for non-max suppression.
        min_box_area (:obj:`int`): **default = 200**. |br|
            Minimum value for area of detected bounding box. Calculated
            by width * height.
        track_buffer (:obj:`int`): **default = 30**. |br|
            Threshold to remove track if track is lost for more frames
            than value.
